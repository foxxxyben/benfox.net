									<h2 class="major">In 2005 I began my consulting</br>
									career in New York...</h2>
									<p>where I helped kickstart a collaboration between District 75 and <a href="http://www.grasp.org" target="_blank">G.R.A.S.P.</a>, an organization dedicated to providing peer-based supports to people on the Autism Spectrum. After the success of this pilot program, I spent the next few years providing training and staff support to teachers and administrators throughout the NYC Public Schools System. Some of this work has been profiled in an <a href="http://reader.mediawiremobile.com/epmagazine/issues/203090/viewer?page=21" target="_blank">Exceptional Parent Magazine</a> article highlighting the benefits of peer support groups in schools.</p>

									<h2 class="major">That same year I started my</br>
									Private Practice in Brooklyn...</h2>
									<p>where I combined the successes of peer-based social skills programs with research-based ABA and Floortime methodologies to develop inclusive <b>Facilitated Social Play</b> programs, where children with Autism or other social learning disorders can learn from "social expert" peers through play. These sessions are facilitated by professionals with advanced Autism training and experience with other complementary interventions. My role is to provide ongoing training, playspace design, program, and professional development to help transform experts accustomed to intensive, 1-on-1 therapeutic settings, into community organizers and volunteer recruiters. I have consulted and worked with families, in-home service providers, private schools and early intervention centers, to help build successful programs <i>and meaningful friendships</i> for children with ASD, that have lasted and grown with them for years.</p>
