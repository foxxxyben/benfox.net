where I managed daily field operations and ran a machine and maintenance shop for a 50-acre vineyard. I enjoy building custom farm equipment and am expanding my shop to provide Research & Development laboratories to design low-cost, high-tech tools for Precision Farming. I offer consulting and project management services to growers and processors to help improve the safety, environmental impact, and economic security of our food systems, with an emphasis on waste-stream reduction, integrated pest management, and designing multi-crop permaculture plans for vineyard and orchard management.
