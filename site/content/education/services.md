After living and farming in the Tri-Cities for years I have relaunched my practice to better meet the needs of the surrounding communities. In addition to providing training, seminars, consulting and program development for Facilitated Social Play groups, I am also seeking opportunities to collaborate with local schools and community organizations to build innovative, inclusive programs to help children and young adults with Autism find their Awesome.
