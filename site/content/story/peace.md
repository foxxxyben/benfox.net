Much of my work with adolescents involves a great deal of teaching conflict resolution and community organization techniques to young adults on the Spectrum, their families, and the many educators that support them. I earned my Master's Degree in International Peace, Conflict, and Development Studies from the [University Jaume I](https://www.uji.es/estudis/oferta/base/masters/actual/centre/fchs/pau-2013/) in Castellon, Spain, and in addition to my own consulting services in Special Education, I also represent an international network of Peace Educators, Consultants, and Researchers that I can call upon to collaborate on a wide range of violence-prevention and community development programs.
