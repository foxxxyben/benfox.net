In 2005 I began my career as a professional consultant to the New York City Public Schools, helping to develop city-wide peer-based support programs to adolescents on the Autism Spectrum. Later that same year I began my private practice helping families and private schools develop play-based social skills programs for young children with Autism.

I have provided consulting, training and professional development, direct care, program management and coordination of services in a highly complex school system, and have worked collaboratively with a wide range of public and private schools, early intervention centers, in-home service providers, families and community groups, to help build successful programs <i>and meaningful friendships</i> for children with ASD, that have lasted and grown with them for years.

As a <a href="https://apps.ibcces.org/badges/v/65d52" target="_blank">Certified Autism Specialist</a> I am now offering my experience and expertise in providing professional consulting services to families, schools, community organizations, and care providers across Eastern Washington.
