where I combined the successes of peer-based social skills programs with research-based ABA and Floortime methodologies to develop inclusive <b>Facilitated Social Play</b> programs, where children with Autism or other social learning disorders can learn from "social expert" peers through play. These sessions are facilitated by professionals with advanced Autism training and experience with other complementary interventions. My role is to provide ongoing training, playspace design, program, and professional development to help transform experts accustomed to intensive, 1-on-1 therapeutic settings, into community organizers and volunteer recruiters. I have consulted and worked with families, in-home service providers, private schools and early intervention centers, to help build successful programs <i>and meaningful friendships</i> for children with ASD, that have lasted and grown with them for years.
